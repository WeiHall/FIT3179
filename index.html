            Demographic of Players
          </h2>
          <p>
            The choropleth map demonstrates the overall diversity of the Premier League, with every continent having some degree of representation.
            As expected, many of the players come from the <span class="bolded">United Kingdom</span>, where the Premier League is run. There are also
            many players from surrounding footballing nations in Europe, such as <span class="bolded">Spain</span> and <span class="bolded">France</span>.
            Whilst Europe has the greatest representation, South American countries such as <span class="bolded">Brazil</span> and <span class="bolded">Argentina</span>
            are also reasonably involved, illustrating the high diversity amongst countries.

            Differences Between Teams
          </h2>
          <p>
            All 20 teams within the 2020 Premier League season are run by <br> different owners, each with their own strategies as to how they <br> manage their players to achieve the greatest
            amount of success. <br> The team with the greatest amount of success (as judged by <br> win-rate) is <span class="bolded mancity">Manchester City</span>, being the only team to win
            more <br> than 60% of its games. The age distribution amongst clubs show <br> that most clubs have players of roughly the same age, with many <br> of them having a median age in the 24-25 age
            range. This suggests <br> that the age range of a team is not necessarily a key differentiating <br> factor between teams, as most teams are very similar in this <br> regard. The position distribution
            for most clubs also remains <br> relatively constant amongst each other, with almost all clubs <br> investing primarily into <span class="bolded midfielder">midfielders</span> and <span class="bolded defender">defenders</span>.

          <h2>
            How Does Offence Affect Win-Rate?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The most successful offensive team is <span class="bolded mancity">Manchester City</span>, with the least successful being <span class="bolded astonvilla">Aston Villa</span>.
            The key goalscorers of the former are mostly highly experienced and prolific <span class="bolded forward">forwards</span>, whereas the latter has much less experienced goalscorers
            coming from different positions. This suggests that investment into key forward players is crucial for success.

          <h2>
            How Does Defence Affect Win-Rate?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The most successful defensive team is <span class="bolded liverpool">Liverpool</span>, with the least successful being <span class="bolded astonvilla">Aston Villa</span>. The main defensive
            contributions of the former surprisingly arise from mostly non-defensive positions, whereas the latter has almost all of their contributions from exclusively defensive players. This suggests
            that having offensively positioned players that can contribute defensively may create significant benefit for a club.
